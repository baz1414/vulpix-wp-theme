# Vulpix WordPress Theme

> Vulpix is a small, quadruped, fox-like PokÃ©mon. It has a red-brown pelt with a cream-colored underbelly. It has brown 
> eyes, large, pointed ears with dark brown insides, and a triangular dark brown nose. Its paws are slightly darker than
> the rest of its pelt and have light brown paw pads. On top of its head are three curled locks of orange fur with bangs, 
> and it has orange tails with curled tips. It is most commonly seen with six tails. However, Vulpix is born with only a 
> single, white tail that splits as Vulpix grows. The tails grow hot as it approaches evolution.
